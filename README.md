This data contained Mathematical performance for PISA
Mathematical performance, for PISA, measures the mathematical literacy of a 15-year-old to formulate,
employ and interpret mathematics in a variety of contexts to describe, predict and explain phenomena,
recognizing the role that mathematics plays in the world.
I compared and showed that the Maths performance level of girls and boys at age 15 in Australia between
the years 2003-2018 and also showed know if there's a growth or decline over the years. From the visual, it
is observed that the performance level of both genders reduced over the years and we also see that the
performance level of boys was still higher than that of girls as the year increases
